This folder holds special cases for inputs to the algorithm. These are obstacles are defined by their vertices
in the plane (i.e. x and y coordinate). Note that the algorithm itself deals with finding the correct counterclockwise
traversal of the vertices, so don't need to worry about that in these files. Simply specify the nodes in some order.
